# Reflection – Chatbot Project

## What Worked
The rule-based chatbot worked correctly using JSON knowledge files.
The chatbot was able to answer questions after loading the knowledge properly.
Features like validation, gap detection, and tagging also worked as expected.

## What Confused Me
Initially, I was confused about loading multiple JSON files and handling missing data.
Understanding why some answers were rejected due to validation rules took some time.

## What I Improved
I improved the chatbot by adding better validation, a knowledge gap dashboard, and manual knowledge updates.
I also added local Indian knowledge with proper tagging and ensured there was no external dependency.
